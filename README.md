# TNTAPP
### An online note-taking app which stores your data/notes locally on your computer. It does not store your data or send it to any remote servers thereby ensuring your privacy.


#### Features
* Notes are stored locally on your computer.
* You can delete a note.
* You will never lose your data unless you lose your device or clear browser.

#### TODO
* Add prioritise feature as in tnt2
* Add 'backup to server' feature so you can backup you notes to the server in the event that clearing your browser data clears your notes or you lose your phone.
* Add feature to Encrypt notes
* Perhaps add feature to add images?
